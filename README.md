# Database-Work-Log
This application records information about a task a user has preformed. The work log can have numerous users and all of the information is stored in a database. The current user can store a task name, time spent, general notes and more along with retrieving the imputed information. This can be  either for the current user, or for other users of the application.

When using the test_database_log.py file to check the tests there is some flashing text. When using coverage on the program use the command
"coverage run test_database_log.py -b" to get rid of any text the test file wants to show you.
